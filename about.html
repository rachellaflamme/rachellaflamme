  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p class= "text"><img class = "aboutpic" src = "profilepic.jpeg" style = "float:left; width: 300px;">I am a recent Smith College graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Statistical and Data Sciences with a passion for data.<br>
  <br> Actually, I am more passionate about the story behind each data point. I love looking into how different influencers impact where the data point is in comparison to the rest of the data being collected. This passion became the fuel that sparked the idea behind a project I am working on called Survival of the Fitted. Survival of the Fitted is an algorithm that predicts the correct clothing size to purchase when shopping online only using the size, brand, and style number of the userâ€™s favorite clothing item, rather than asking for personal body measurements. The fundamentals of this venture are based on data and see if we can predict fit by using the ratios of the exact measurements of the clothing item to see which body type would fit best, what style the user is looking for, etc. </p>
